# Ocean demo in WebGPU

This is a port to [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/) of the great project [FFT-Ocean](https://github.com/gasgiant/FFT-Ocean): all credits to Ivan Pensionerov (https://github.com/gasgiant)!

Link to the demo: https://popov72.github.io/OceanDemo/dist/index.html

You can also browse this demo in the Babylon.js Playground: https://playground.babylonjs.com/#YX6IB8#39

Use F8 to show/hide the GUI (after you click anywhere in the rendering area to give focus to the canvas) and WASD to move.

**Note that your browser needs to support WebGPU!**
